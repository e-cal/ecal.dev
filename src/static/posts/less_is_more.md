# Less is More

Last summer I visited Spain. While I was there, I had a single goal in mind:
learning to make paella. So I crammed a cooking class into the already packed
schedule, and took a day trip to Valencia.

I had only tried paella a few times prior, and most times it was kind of a let down.
A bland plate of rice packed with dry chicken and vegetables. But then I had my
first _good_ paella and realized what this dish could be. Decadent rice
complemented by the other ingredients rather than overwhelmed by them, made in
a giant pan over a wood fire right before my eyes. It was like a whole different
dish.

> _Most North American paella was overloaded_.

The class started by heading to the market. A giant warehouse filled with vendors
selling the freshest food you've ever seen. Fresh fruits and vegetables, perfectly
ripe, and grown just outside the city. Meats fresh or cured, separated into countless
different cuts and qualities. A whole section dedicated to fish caught fresh earlier
that morning.

> _Every ingredient was delicious on its own_.

Then we got to the kitchen. We had bottomless sangria, tons of tasty appetizers
prepared with the same fresh market ingredients, and Spanish music blasting. The
instructor had one of us as the dedicated salt person to add a pinch with every
ingredient. The others prepared the ingredients for each next step as the meal
came together in the pan. We seared the chicken and rabbit, moved them aside for
the beans and garlic, grated the tomatoes and pulverized the precious saffron for
the sofrito, and cooked the bomba to perfection with a thin sweet layer of socarrat
along the bottom. It was one of the best meals I've ever had.

> _What struck me was how **simple** it was_.

I'm proud to say I can now make a pretty awesome traditional Valencian paella, but
that wasn't the main takeaway of the class. The one thing that the instructor said
that stuck with me the most was

> _"Paella is a rice dish. The rice should be amazing on its own, the toppings
> are just extra."_

I now hold this as a guiding principle for ~everything in life. For something to
be great, the _core thing_ needs to be great. Before in my cooking I would constantly
ask myself "what else could I add to make this delicious" but now I see how wrong
that entire premise is.

> _If something isn't great in its simplest form, adding complexity can at best
> mask the shortcomings_.

This applies to more than just cooking. In programming, you can't make a product 
good by adding a million features if the core thing sucks. If the main plot of a
story is boring, flashy cgi or funny jokes can't save it. In learning 
you can't get a deep intuition for some advanced topic if you don't understand
the basics. But if your main product is incredible, if your plot is gripping, and
if you've mastered the basics, then adding the extras will take you to the next
level.

> **To make a great paella, first make the rice itself great.**
