Recent arch to nixos convert, my dotfiles
are an ongoing passion project. I basically live in the terminal, and through my
deeply custom window manager + nvim + terminal + tmux configs and countless bash
& python [scripts](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles/tree/main/shared/scripts), moving through the shell and editing code is more muscle
memory than an active effort. I'm especially proud of my [tmux session manager](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles/blob/main/shared/scripts/tm)
which since writing I couldn't live without.
