The python **m**odel **acq**uisition toolkit is the new standard
library for all things model acquisition in the field of automated
planning research. I designed and authored the library during my research
internship at [MuLab](https://mulab.ai), and continue to maintain it alongside
Christian Muise.

macq offers a foundational API for working with PDDL problems,
traces, and planners in python. It contains an ever-growing collection of model
acquisition algorithm implementations for inferring planning models from
complete traces and translating the inferred action models back to PDDL.
