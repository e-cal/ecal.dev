The Model Acquisition Toolkit. The new standard library for all things model acquisition related in the field of automated planning. I co-authored and maintain this library. Initially built as part of my research internship at the MuLab, this project is largely comprised of translating the algorithms from related papers into code - an excellent way to learn!
