VAAD: virtual assistant attention detection. A face tracker + attention detection
system to act as the activation mechanism for virtual assistants like
Google Home / Alexa / Siri. The goal was to build a more human-like way of interacting
with these assistants; instead of yelling a keyword and hoping it hears you, with
VAAD you can simply address it like you would a coworker.
