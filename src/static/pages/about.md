## Developer

Lead AI/ML developer at [RedBit](https://redbitdev.com), where I'm
building intelligent tools and helping clients across various industries
figure out how they can best leverage AI.

Currently building:

- automated product image generation tools for Print Geek, an on-demand printing service
- a platform to save massive amounts of time and money on contract bidding
- tools to handle the boilerplate work for teachers, so they can focus on teaching not paperwork

_Always open to more_

## Hobbyist

Coding and experimenting with AI is more than just work to me, it's my passion.
I love [exploring latent space](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com), and following
others' experiments. 

Language models are so much more than simple tools, they are an embodiment of 
the aggregate human psyche (trained on the ~entire internet after all), and by
exploring hidden parts of the distribution you can uncover some [fascinating stuff](https://generative.ink/posts).

<hr>

Also a linux hobbyist. Recent arch to nixos convert, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles)
are an ongoing passion project. I have a somewhat popular [neovim config](https://github.com/e-cal/evim)
featuring a custom [llm chat plugin](https://github.com/e-cal/chat.nvim).

I basically live in the terminal, and through my deeply custom
environment, my computer is an extension of myself.
