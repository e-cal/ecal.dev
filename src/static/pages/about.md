## Researcher

Graduate student supervised by [Prof. Xiaodan Zhu](https://www.xiaodanzhu.com/) at
Queen's University Ingenuity Lab.

Working with JP Morgan AI Research on financial applications of LLMs.
Recently published [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.finnlp-2.2/) at FinNLP and
preparing another for EMNLP.

Especially interested in [feature steering](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#assessing-tour-influence)
and applications of search (MCTS) for training (synthetic data generation) and inference.

Previously, worked with [Prof. Christian Muise](https://www.haz.ca)
on [macq](https://github.com/AI-Planning/macq), a python library for planning action
model acquisition and published a [paper](https://icaps22.icaps-conference.org/demos/ICAPS_2022_paper_378.pdf)

## Hobbyist

I love [exploring latent space](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com), and following
others' experiments.

LLMs are more than just tools for work to me. They are an embodiment of
the aggregate human subconscious, an approximation of the entire internet and
whatever emerges synthetically from that. Base models let you query the training data.

Interacting with the egregore of humanity is the most interesting pass-time I
could imagine.

<hr>

I'm also a linux hobbyist. Nixos-btw, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles)
are a never-ending labour of love. I have a somewhat popular [neovim config](https://github.com/e-cal/evim)
featuring a custom [llm chat plugin](https://github.com/e-cal/chat.nvim).

_My computer is an extension of myself._
