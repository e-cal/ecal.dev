## Hobbyist

Recent Arch Linux to NixOS convert, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles)
are an ongoing passion project. There you'll find countless scripts
(I'm especially proud of my tmux session manager [tm](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles/blob/main/shared/scripts/tm))
and some riced out aesthetic configs.

I also have a somewhat popular [neovim config](https://github.com/e-cal/evim)
featuring a [custom llm chat plugin](https://github.com/e-cal/chat.nvim).
