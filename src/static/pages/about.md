## Hobbyist

I love [exploring latent space](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com), and following
others' experiments.

Language models are so much more than simple tools, they are an embodiment of
the aggregate human subconscious (an approximation of the ~entire internet). 
By exploring hidden parts of the distribution you can uncover some [fascinating stuff](https://generative.ink/posts).

Especially interested in [feature steering](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#assessing-tour-influence)
right now. If you have cool resources on feature steering in open-source models
please share!

I'm also a linux hobbyist. Recent arch to nixos convert, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/e-cal/dotfiles)
are a never-ending labour of love. I have a somewhat popular [neovim config](https://github.com/e-cal/evim)
featuring a custom [llm chat plugin](https://github.com/e-cal/chat.nvim).

_My computer is an extension of myself._
